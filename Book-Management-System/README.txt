You are responsible for enhancing a Book Management System.

In the provided zip file, you will find two services that need to be run locally. The backend service has basic functionality to support the existing frontend code, while the frontend project has basic functionality, but no styling at present.
To set up the services locally, please refer to the README files included with each project.

Your tasks include:
- Replace the "Published Date" text field with a date picker component.
- Style the web application as you see fit, utilising any libraries or frameworks of your choice.
- Integrate the provided backend API "deleteBook" to enable book deletion functionality in the app.
- Add in any missing tests to BookRepositoryTest.java
- Change the code to extract an Author JPA entity with a name field, instead of the current implementation where author is a field of the Book entity. The book and Author entities should then be related.
- Add a graphQL query to the backend service to support filtering books by date.
- Enhance the frontend project to add the ability to filter out old books.
- Write unit tests for the system functionality (some initial tests have been included to guide you).

We encourage you to dedicate a few hours to this project, seeing it as an opportunity to showcase your skills and approach. While we don't expect a perfect solution, we're keen to see how you tackle the problem, your coding practices, and how you manage your time. This is your chance to demonstrate your abilities and highlight your skill set.
